## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

-machine learning model to forecast election results at the state level; include confidence interval
-can be used, for example, to find probability that PA goes blue in 2028--will obviously be less accurate over time
-data taken from MIT Election Data and Science Lab, 2017, "U.S. President 1976-2016", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/42MVDX, Harvard Dataverse, V5, UNF:6:Mw0hOUHAijKPTVRAe5jJvg== [fileUNF]

```{r read_file}
options(digits = 3)
library(tidyverse)
filename <- '1976-2016-president.csv'
read_lines(filename, n_max = 3)
file <- read.csv(filename)
```

-filter to only rep and dem for each state
-very small inaccuracy introduced by throwing away write-ins--even if for major party candidate

```{r simlify_data}
# filter to only rep and dem for each state; very small inaccuracy introduced by throwing away write-ins--even if for major party candidate
# wild there isn't a better not in function
'%ni%' <- Negate('%in%')
dem <- file %>% filter(party %in% c('democrat', "democratic-farmer-labor") & candidate %ni% c('Other', '') & writein == FALSE) %>% select(year, state_po, candidatevotes, totalvotes) %>% mutate(party = 'democrat')
rep <- file %>% filter(party == 'republican' & writein == FALSE) %>% select(year, state_po, party, candidatevotes, totalvotes)
votes_simple <- data.frame(year = dem$year, state = dem$state_po, percent_dem = dem$candidatevotes / (rep$candidatevotes + dem$candidatevotes))
```



```{r plot_all_states, include = FALSE}
ggplot(votes_simple, aes(year, percent_dem, col = state)) + geom_line() +
  geom_text(aes(label = state), size = 3.5) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
